# Decentralised Finance (DeFi)

This is an umbrella term for applications in the blockchain work built specifically to disrupt the traditional finance ecosystem.
In summary, they are financial applications built on top of the blockchain technologies, typically using smart contracts.
Below, I have highlighted 5 of such defi projects

## Colony labs

This ranked between 1st - 3rd position of top defi projects to watch out for in 2022, cited by many different articles. It is built on the Avalanche blockchain. The aim of the colony labs project is to provide early-stage funding for applications built on the avalanche network. It is heavily reliant on community

## Fantom

Fantom is one of the blockchains that spun up as an alternative to ethereum by providing faster transaction processing times and lower fees. It is an open source smart contracts platform for decentralised apps and digital assets.
It offers a unique consensus mechanism called “Lachesis”, which is responsible for its speed. Because it is a smart contract-enabled blockchain, it makes it a robust environment for dApp development

## Polkadot

It allows independent blockchains to communicate and exchange information and transactions in a seamless manner over the polkadot relay chain. This, just like fantom puts Polkadot at a more scalable and faster position over ethereum

## Polygon

Also known as matic, is a widely accepted Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution, which means its goal is to relieve ethereum level 1 of a lot of all its pressure, considering the ethereum blockchain currently houses a very large percentage of defi projects

## Solana

It is revolutionising consensus mechanisms with its “proof of history” concept. This means that, instead of mining or staking on the platform to validate transactions, all transactions are proven true by a time stamp on the blockchain. Solana is known as Ethereum’s main competitor because it provides fast speeds while still being a Layer 1 platform, meaning it doesn’t need any help from another platform to perform these quick transactions.
