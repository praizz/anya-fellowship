# Blockchain Networks

As of May 2022, there are currently over 1000 blockchains, which are all split between 4 distinct blockchain networks. This number is constantly growing however, with each network having its leverages and disadvantages over the other networks.
The blockchain networks are highlighted below:

## Public Blockchain Networks

This is also known as the permissionless blockchain network. It is fully decentralised, being that it eliminates issues that may arise from centralisation like transparency and security amongst many others.
It is non restrictive, any user with access to the internet can sign up and participate, it is usually open source, transparent, anonymous and secure to a large extent.

However, significant computing power is required, there is little or no privacy for transactions, and security is inadequate, because it is fully decentralised, it means it is at more risk of attack over the other types of networks.
Sample Blockchains utilising the public blockchain network include but not limited to:

- Bitcoin (Distributed Ledger Token)
- Ethereum

## Private Blockchain Networks

This is a partially decentralised solution. Blockchains in this network are only accessible by authorised nodes e.g an organisation.
It is managed, and they are permissioned
Sample blockchains that utilise private networks are:

- Ripple: a business-to-business virtual currency exchange network
- Hyperledger: an umbrella project for open-source blockchain applications

“Both private and public blockchains have disadvantages: Public blockchains take longer to validate new data than private blockchains, and private blockchains are more susceptible to fraud and bad actors. Also, the centralised approach frequently encourages an over-reliance on third-party management tools and favours the same few industry participants. Consortium blockchains were created to overcome these flaws.”

## Hybrid Blockchain Networks

This is a combination of both the public and private blockchain networks to amass the benefits of both realms. This affords organisations to have both permissioned private networks and permissionless public networks, thereby giving them control over who has access to the network

This brings about better performance, access control and stability amongst others.
Networks like these are majorly used by real estate and medical records

## Consortium Blockchain Networks

Like the name implies, it is a permissioned blockchain network setup by a consortium of companies. It has a lot more security because it necessitates a lot of collaboration between several businesses/ organisations.
In other words, it’s a private blockchain with restricted access to a specific group for removing risks that come from only a single entity controlling said network as it is on a private blockchain network

Consortium blockchain networks are used in supply chains, banking and research
